Here is how to fix it:

    1. The Quick Fix: Reload VS Code
    Since you have fixed your configuration files, you just need to force the extension to restart and read them again.

    Press Cmd + Shift + P (Command Palette).

    Type "Reload Window" and press Enter.

    Wait for the extension to load (look for the "dbt" icon in the bottom status bar).

    Try compiling or previewing your SQL again.

2. Verify Python Interpreter
    If reloading doesn't work, the extension might be looking at the wrong Python environment (one where dbt isn't installed or is a different version).

    Press Cmd + Shift + P.

    Type "Python: Select Interpreter".

    Crucial: Select the interpreter inside your project's virtual environment (.venv or venv). It usually has a star or says "Recommended".

    Look for: ./.venv/bin/python
